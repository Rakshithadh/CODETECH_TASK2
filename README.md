# Project Overview: **Student Grade Tracker**
The Grade Tracker UI is a Java Swing application designed to help users track and manage student grades across different subjects or assignments. The application calculates the average grade, determines the corresponding letter grade, and computes the GPA (Grade Point Average) based on user input.

# Features
- **User-Friendly Interface:** The application features an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) with fields and buttons that make it easy to input grades and calculate results.
- **Customizable Grade Inputs:** Users can specify the number of subjects or assignments they want to track, and the application dynamically generates the required input fields.
- **Automatic Calculation:** The application calculates:
        - Average Grade: The mean of all entered grades.
        - Letter Grade: A letter grade based on the average (A, B, C, D, F).
        - GPA: A numerical GPA based on the letter grade, with an A equivalent to 9.0 and an F equivalent to 0.0.
- **Error Handling:** The application provides clear error messages if the user enters invalid data, ensuring that only valid grades are processed.
- **Customizable Background Colors:** The GUI features a blue theme with different background colors for various panels, making the interface visually appealing.

# How to Use
